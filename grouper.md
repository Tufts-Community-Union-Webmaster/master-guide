# Access to Shared Inboxes & Internal Distribution Lists

The Tufts Community Union government utilizes multiple internal distribution lists and shared inboxes.

## Shared Inboxes

In order to maximize the transparency and accessibility for the student body as well as ease-of-use for the TCU Government:

- Shared inboxes should be the main point of communication and point of contact for all government operations.

- No alternative emails such as Gmail accounts should ever be created or used.

- Shared inboxes should be consistently checked. Replies should originate from the shared inbox account.

- Whenever not being checked, shared inboxes should have out of office notifications.

#### Importance of Using Shared Inboxes

Shared inboxes are a key tool for the TCU for everyday tasks. They help students communicate with their elected representatives using Tufts-owned & Tufts-managed platforms; having Tufts-integrated points of communication are especially important for transparency and accessibility purposes. For example, students may not have instagram nor trust emailing a random gmail account. For these reasons, communication with the student body should mainly take place on these shared inbox accounts (supplemented by checking Instagram DMs and other applicable areas). No email platform (like Gmail) should ever be used for email communication. Gmail also uses passwords instead of Tufts account integrated access; historically, they have been hard to transition properly across terms and often get lost and unused.

#### Successfully Using Shared Inboxes

Shared inboxes should be advertised on the website and in all Instagram bios. Whenever students need to contact the TCU with information, the designated shared inbox should always be used. For example, ECOM should always use their inbox to answer students' questions regarding elections and communicate with candidates using these inboxes. Additionally, these inboxes must be checked frequently by multiple individuals. Replies should originate from the shared inbox, except in special circumstances. Out of office replies should always be enabled when inboxes are not being checked.
